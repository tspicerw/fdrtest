Front-end Developer Test

Objective: Build out a D3 chart and a simple two column layout that condenses to a one column layout. On mobile only, a user can click the heading to expand and collapse the sub content.

Rules:
1. Feel free to use frameworks for the HTML.
2. For the expand there should only be one open at a time.
3. You may not use any plugins, the actions should be controlled by pure javascript or react.
4. For the data visualization, please ensure the chart is responsive.
5. For the data visualization, please use D3 with react for the date controls.

Data for the data visualization component:
